## Instructions
### HTML
I created a (div) contans three divs for the score panel ( success, miss, level), and tow for modals.

### CSS
Some Baisic styling to the classes, specialy the popup classes.

### JS
Because Udacity give us the Game engine the way of constructing the Game will be simply like this :
.First of all open the Console to fix the errors and to know how the engine works.
.Then give the Enemies Variables (x,y position and speed), and draw the enemy on the screen.
.The Enemies Updates to give them random speeds connect with levels , the collision between player and enemies.
.Do the same to the player but connect the (x,y) position with the keys (arrows keys).
.Now instantiate your objects.
.Our score update (success, miss, level).
.Then at least our modal.

## How to Play
please open index.html in a browser
use arrow keys to move the player to avoid the enemies and reach the water you have only 3 lifes.
every 5 successes will move you one level up till the end of level 3 .
